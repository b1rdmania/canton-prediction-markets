# Doc Restructure Plan

## Goal
Cleanly restructure docs to match the current and next MVPs and archive the legacy plan, so stakeholders/devs see an accurate, tight scope.

## Steps
1) Rewrite `MVP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` into three clear parts:
   - Demo MVP v0 (current)
   - Phase 2 — Weekly Pool MVP (new Canton/DAML/USDC.x plan)
   - Appendix — Archived legacy 14-week plan (historical)
2) Keep `HANDOFF_DEMO_MVP.md` as the operational runbook (only minor consistency tweaks if needed).
3) Add `PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md` (one page) listing what we build vs what we explicitly don’t build for this cycle.

## Scope/Constraints
- Documentation only; no code/infra changes.
- Align messaging with the current direction: one weekly binary pool on Canton, DAML contracts, USDC.x settlement, no orderbook, single resolution path.
